    <h2 class="description">This is Grandma's recipe the best flour tortillas I know!</h2>
    <p class="subdesc">This recipe uses Mexican brand "INCA" for the fat in the batter, testing this in other countries might become a challenge.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Vegetable Fat - INCA - 250 gr</li>
        <li>Wheat Flour - 1 kg</li>
        <li>Water - 500 ml</li>
        <li>Salt - 30 gr</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk vegetable fat in a bowl until it gets a creamy consistency. An electrical whisk is recommended, but this can also be done with bare hands.</li>
        <li>Add salt to fat.</li>
        <li>Add flour into mix, mix by hand until no fat is visible anywhere in the bowl.</li>
        <li>Slowly add 500 ml of water to mix while hand mixing the batter.</li>
        <li>Keep mixing by hand for a long while. Make sure all ingrediends are mixed completely and no clumps are left anywhere.</li>
        <li>Once it's all mixed well, make balls of dough and place in plate or separate bowl.</li>
        <li>Once done making balls of dough with the entire mix, cover with plastic foil and let it sit for at least 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Spread flour on tray or clean table to roll the tortillas in. You need some sleight of hand magic to make sure they end up round and even.</li>
        <li>Cook on pan on low heat stove, each tortilla should be done quick.</li>
    </ol>
